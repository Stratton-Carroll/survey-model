## Key Findings

### Top Priority Areas (by frequency and urgency):
1. **Training & Development** - 227 mentions (most critical need)
2. **Resource Constraints** - 128 mentions (funding/budget challenges)
3. **Clinical Competencies** - 99 mentions (clinical skills development)
4. **Time Constraints** - 85 mentions (scheduling/staffing challenges)
5. **Technology Innovation** - 63 mentions (digital health adoption)

### Healthcare Roles Most Frequently Mentioned:
- **Nursing** (130 mentions) - Highest training and development needs
- **Physicians** (126 mentions) - Recruitment and retention challenges

### Urgency Analysis:
- **93.8%** Medium priority items
- **5.1%** High urgency/critical needs
- **1.1%** Low priority/future considerations

## Data Quality Assessment

- **Average response rate**: 75.3% across all questions
- **Open-ended questions**: 70-95% response rates (excellent engagement)
- **Multiple choice questions**: 0% response rate (technical issues in survey)
- **Missing data**: Primarily in demographic fields and technical questions

## Healthcare Domain Tagging System

The analysis implements a comprehensive tagging taxonomy with:

### Domain Categories:

- `recruitment`: Attracting new professionals
- `retention`: Keeping current staff
- `leadership_management`: Management development
- `clinical_competencies`: Patient care skills
- `technology_innovation`: Digital health adoption
- `interprofessional_collaboration`: Team-based care
- `resource_constraints`: Financial limitations
- `time_constraints`: Scheduling challenges
- `career_advancement`: Professional growth
- `work_life_balance`: Wellness initiatives

### Role Categories:
- `nursing`: All nursing roles
- `physicians`: Doctors and physician roles
- `allied_health`: Therapists, technicians, specialists
- `leadership`: Management and administrative
- `support_staff`: Non-clinical support

### Urgency Levels:
- `high`: Critical, urgent, immediate needs
- `medium`: Important priorities (default)
- `low`: Future or nice-to-have items
