Many individuals entering health care today are not fully prepared for the professional expectations of the workplace. Simple but essential behaviors—such as dressing appropriately, communicating respectfully, showing up on time, and taking accountability for scheduled shifts—are frequently lacking. These aren’t just preferences; they are the baseline requirements for safe, effective care and cohesive team dynamics.

This gap highlights a broader issue: we need to begin reinforcing these skills much earlier—starting in grade school. Just as we teach reading and math, we should be teaching professionalism, time management, and personal responsibility. The next generation of health care professionals will carry immense responsibility, and preparing them means more than clinical training. It means instilling habits and values that enable them to contribute meaningfully and reliably in high-stakes environments.

To build a truly prepared workforce, we must invest not only in technical education but in character and work-readiness education across the developmental pipeline.","The most significant challenge we face is a critical shortage of talent paired with an urgent need to fill vacancies, which significantly impacts our ability to invest in foundational training. Our staffing shortages mean that we often don’t have the bandwidth to provide comprehensive onboarding that covers essential professional skills—from appropriate dress and punctuality to basic workplace etiquette. With so many roles needing to be filled immediately, we find ourselves prioritizing clinical competency over the soft skills that should have been instilled early on. This resource gap—both in terms of time and funding—has made it difficult to equip new team members with the basic skills and knowledge they need at the outset of their careers.","Arkansas Children's offers a variety of training modalities, including:

Online Training Modules: Accessible digital courses allow staff to engage in self-paced learning, accommodating diverse schedules and learning styles.

Classroom Instruction: Structured in-person sessions provide interactive learning experiences for both clinical and non-clinical topics.

Blended Learning Approaches: Combining online and face-to-face instruction ensures comprehensive understanding and skill acquisition.

Team members are afforded dedicated time away from their regular duties to participate fully in these training sessions, emphasizing the organization's commitment to professional development. 

The Arkansas Children's Simulation Education Center (ACSEC) offers immersive training experiences that replicate real-world clinical scenarios. These spaces simulate various healthcare environments, such as inpatient rooms and emergency departments. Additionally, the ACSEC extends its training beyond the facility, utilizing portable technology to conduct simulations in hospitals, outpatient clinics, and communities across Arkansas. ","Expanding graduate medical education is crucial for retaining healthcare professionals. Initiatives by institutions like AWSOM, Mercy, AC, WRMC, and UAMS Northwest to increase residency slots are steps in the right direction. Given that many physicians choose to practice near where they complete their residencies, enhancing these programs can help retain talent locally.","Collaborate with local educational institutions to increase the number of training programs and residency slots in high-need specialties. This approach can help build a pipeline of qualified professionals committed to serving the NWA community. 

Engage with community stakeholders to create a supportive ecosystem for healthcare professionals, including affordable housing initiatives and cultural competency programs, to enhance the overall quality of life for providers and their families.",,"To enhance the retention of healthcare professionals in Northwest Arkansas, it's essential to address both systemic infrastructure and individual career development needs. A strategic approach involves expanding the region's healthcare footprint, particularly by increasing the availability of higher-acuity care services, such as quaternary care. This expansion can make NWA more attractive to specialized providers and offer clear pathways for professional growth.","The state of AR is grappling with significant workforce shortages across several critical healthcare disciplines, including cardiac sonography, catheterization lab technology, multiple radiology modalities, orthoptic care, respiratory therapy, and specialized nursing roles. These shortages are not merely staffing challenges; they represent systemic gaps that hinder the region's ability to provide comprehensive, high-acuity care.",,,,,,,"I'm genuinely interested and fully willing to be part of a team that works to solve these challenges for NWA.

6/27/2025 8:46,6/27/2025 10:06,Mercy Hospital NWA,Benton,Benton,Benton,FALSE,Talent Acquisition Relationship Manager,3 years,Manager,Management,Management,Administrative,2-3 years,bethany.hollis@mercy.net,Yes,"For us, it's all about creating clear and accessible career pathways. The biggest challenge we see is bridging the gap between entry-level roles—often requiring only a high school diploma—and more advanced healthcare careers that we are not able to ""skill up"". They have to attend some sort of licensure/training program to be eligible for the role.

Many individuals struggle with knowing what career to pursue, how to meet prerequisites, get into programs, afford tuition, and balance life demands. To address this, we need to take a multi-pronged approach:

Education & Funding: Helping them understand available educational paths and how to finance them (including Mercy and outside community resources).

Exposure: Providing shadowing opportunities so they can explore different roles and decide what fits.

Program Support: Partnering with universities and technical schools to help candidates get into and succeed in programs.

A major barrier is retention—many drop out during prerequisites or after enrollment due to academic challenges or life obligations like needing to work full-time. Support throughout the entire journey is essential.","First, getting our operational leaders to adopt a long-term mindset. We need to engage with high schools and early college years to promote healthcare careers—explaining why roles like respiratory therapist, pharmacist, or registered nurse matter and offering hands-on opportunities throughout training. These roles must offer good pay and flexibility to attract and retain people, especially as education assistance depends on employment.

Second, the cost of education remains a significant challenge. While Mercy provides support through programs like Upskill and internal education assistance, the wide variation of program cost and acceptance rate remain a challenge to seeing students complete these education programs.","Mercy focuses on building internal career ladders to support employees with little or no experience and help them advance. For example:

Lab Techs: We train individuals from scratch—teaching skills like blood draws—and offer progression from LST 1 to LST 4, with some advancing to become Medical Laboratory Technicians (MLTs). Education assistance is provided to make this possible.

Medical Assistants: Starting with no experience, employees can progress through the career ladder to be eligible to sit for their Registered Medical Assistants (RMAs), earning them a transferable certification beyond Mercy.

Tech Career Ladder: Employees can start as care companions with no CNA license or experience, advance through three skill-based levels with pay increases, and potentially move into nurse tech roles. Those pursuing nursing school can perform advanced skills while training and aim to become RNs or LPNs after graduation.

A key breakthrough was eliminating the requirement for a CNA license to hire techs, which was a Mercy standard, not a state mandate. This flexibility allows hiring and training to be more accessible.

Mercy invests in training by dedicating budget and time, which our leaders appreciate as it lets them teach “the Mercy way” and ensure consistent standards. 
For licensed caregivers like RNs and respiratory therapists, Mercy offers financial support for advanced training, conferences, and specialty certifications (e.g., CCRN, CEN). This investment not only benefits the employees but also strengthens Mercy by cultivating expertise.","The biggest immediate need is more specialized, higher-acuity roles—especially in areas like research and pediatric intensive care (PICU). For example, students interested in PICU work have limited local opportunities; while Arkansas Children’s offers some, there’s no level-one PICU nearby, so candidates are redirected to places like St. Louis or Little Rock. Expanding these specialized roles not only meets community needs but also attracts caregivers seeking advanced, cutting-edge opportunities to grow their careers.

Another opportunity is affordable living. Healthcare margins are tight, limiting our ability to offer competitive salaries. Many caregivers commute in long distances to live in more affordable housing, which is especially difficult for roles requiring on-call availability (e.g., OR and Cath lab staff) who must live within 20-30 minutes of the hospital. This restricts our candidate pool and forces us to offer higher salaries just to attract specialists who can meet these location requirements—something we can’t always sustain. More affordable local housing would help expand the candidate pool and improve recruitment and retention for these critical roles.","The top priority for recruiting healthcare professionals is strong support for early education—in high schools and the first years of college. Currently, each hospital or organization does this independently, often without dedicated staff, so efforts are inconsistent and less effective. This is a shared challenge that calls for a community-wide approach, rather than competing efforts between Washington Regional, Highlands, Mercy, and others. Together, we can build robust pipelines for careers like respiratory therapy and radiologic tech, letting candidates decide later where they want to work.

We’re also seeing value in recruiting experienced professionals, especially those connected to major local employers like Tyson, JB Hunt, and Walmart. A strategic opportunity lies in coordinating recruitment to support dual-career couples—for example, helping healthcare spouses find jobs at these companies to encourage relocation. Currently, many spouses move first for non-healthcare jobs (Tyson, JB Hunt, and Walmart) and then seek healthcare roles locally. Reversing this could make NWA even more attractive by ensuring both partners have employment lined up before they move.

Another important point is the frequent workforce reductions businesses face. If we could strengthen community partnerships to support employees affected by layoffs, we could help connect them to high-need, entry-level roles in healthcare. For example, when Mercy reduces staff, our internal recruitment team helps those employees find other open positions within our system. Imagine if we could do this on a broader community scale—say, if Walmart lays off 200 people, is there a way to connect those individuals to healthcare roles, even if they’ve never considered a career in healthcare before? Long term could link them to training programs like Upskill, we could help turn these job losses into career opportunities, moving people from just having ""jobs"" to building long-term healthcare careers.","To advance and elevate healthcare professionals, we need more community-based leadership training. One idea is to create a regional leadership development program for all healthcare organizations.

Direct leadership consistently ranks as a top factor in employee satisfaction. Yet many frontline leaders—especially on high-volume units like med-surg—manage 80 to 100 people and face immense pressure. These roles require coordination across departments, and increasingly, they're filled by younger professionals with just 2–3 years of experience. While it’s great to see early ambition, the demands often lead to burnout and high turnover, especially with challenges like night shift coverage and poor work-life balance.

A shared, community-driven training effort—leveraging best practices across Mercy, Washington Regional, Highlands, and local universities—could better support leaders at all levels. Strengthening leadership today is critical for building a strong pipeline of future directors, VPs, and C-suite executives. Robust succession planning starts with strong support now.","One key area I haven't mentioned is the need for better access to clinical placements. With a limited number of healthcare organizations in NWA, we need a more coordinated, community-wide approach to managing and distributing clinical opportunities. 

Currently, placements are often based on personal relationships, with no consistent evaluation or reallocation process. We should consider creating a shared system to track, evaluate, and distribute clinical placements more equitably. In my opinion, factors like program success rates (e.g., NCLEX pass rates), student retention in the area, and overall training quality should influence how placements are prioritized.

Many programs say they could double enrollment if they had more clinical sites—they have the faculty but not the hands-on opportunities. At Mercy, we’re building a clinical simulation lab with ALIGN grant funds and plan to open it to outside programs to help address this bottleneck.

If we come together as a region to develop standards and share resources, we can use existing clinical space more strategically—training professionals who stay and serve in NWA, rather than losing them to other regions.","The roles that need the most support are those we can’t train in-house—positions that require formal education and licensure, like registered nurses, respiratory therapists, rad techs, and dietitians. While we offer strong career ladders for some roles, these licensure-dependent positions require external programs, time, and financial support, which we can’t provide internally. These are critical gaps we need help addressing.",,,,,,,

Building a new GME program at a hospital and the ACGME application process for a new program takes an average of 2 years per program to achieve accreditation due to the ACGME timeline constraints with the accreditation review committees for each specialty.  The program cannot enter the match until it receives full accreditation from ACGME.  Medical student education is limited without mature residencies and fellowships for the medical student rotations.  There are six core residencies that medical students must have exposure :  Pediatrics EM FM Psychiatry IM and Surgery.  All six core residencies are required in order to build additional residencies and fellowships. ,"Funding to pay for the startup and sustainment funding for new programs.
Insufficient GME staff to devote to new program startups.

Culture change for hospitals to support GME.","Each program must develop it's own didactic curriculum per ACGME.  Online training can supplement didactics in addition to sim training, but faculty physicians must train and teach didactics to the residents and fellows.  ",see above.,Support an extensive GME expansion in NWA.   ACNW needs to build a PICU so ACNW can support a pediatric residency.  Pediatric residency program requires a PICU.  Many residencies require a pediatric rotation (EM FM and Neurology).  Grow our own physicians and specialist from our own NWA programs who wish to teach learners. ,..,Funding and GME leadership collaboration to expand GME across all stakeholders. For example:  It will take a village ie. more than one hospital to start a surgery residency for the ACGME case experience requirements to be met.  Not one hospital in NWA has the case volume to support most surgical specialty programs. ,The physicians and specialists who generate the largest RVU.  Generating RVU ie. producing income is at odds with teaching GME.  Physicians must slow down to teach. ,,,,,,,"The only pathway is to build GME.  UAMS has the only GME ACGME Sponsoring Institution ( UAMS Regional Centers) in NWA that can build residency programs and fellowships.  An ACGME sponsoring institution application takes approximately 2 years to complete.  Then the entity must build it's first residency program within a year of accreditation of the sponsoring institution.  Fellowships are limited as most require experiences in these residencies (surgery FM IM Psychiatry Pediatrics EM). Therefore, if NWA were to start another sponsoring institution now, it would be 4 years before the sponsoring institution could take it's first resident and close to 5 years before the residency program could support medical students. Fellowships may be built after residency programs have continued accreditation status.  A program is awarded  ACGME continued accreditation status after 2 years of operation. "

To strengthen our healthcare workforce, we must prioritize training in trauma-informed care, shared decision-making, evidence-based practice, and screening for social determinants of health (SDOH). These skills support patient-centered, equitable care by addressing both clinical needs and the broader context of health. This approach to care also helps protect healthcare workers from burnout by fostering deeper connection, purpose, and shared responsibility in the care process.","The most significant challenges are chronic short staffing in labor and delivery units and limited resources to pay for training programs. Additionally, there is a lack of accessible training tailored to maternal-child health providers that addresses the unique challenges in maternity care—such as legal concerns, high acuity, and staffing pressures—while still supporting trauma-informed care and shared decision-making.","Online training modules, onsite training, reimbursement, and external trainings","Improve workplace culture and well-being, including mental health support, peer support programs, and policies that reduce burnout.

Specifically, many of our rural counties lack maternity care services provided by family physicians and many rural hospitals have discontinued maternity care labor and delivery services.  This lack of knowledge, skills and resources for family physicians has contributed to the high maternal and infant mortality rates in Arkansas.  Most 3-year Family Medicine residency training programs are not equipped to provide the level of training that would prepare graduates to offer full-scope family practice including maternity care.  In order for the small percentage of graduates who desire further opportunities for advanced FM OB training, they have to seek out a 1-2 year FM OB Fellowship program, adding to the length of their training as well as the cost.  UAMS El Dorado has just opened the first FM OB Fellowship program in our state, taking only 1 fellow per year.  Others who seek this training must go out of state and often do not return.  There will never be enough OB/Gyn residency graduates in Arkansas to meet the needs of all of the maternity deserts that we have, and most OB doctors do not choose to practice in underserved rural counties.   Therefore, family medicine physicians must and can provide these services if adequate training opportunities exist to fill the void.  Family physicians are more likely to practice in rural areas.  We need to support the development of more FM OB Fellowships in Arkansas, produce more well-trained and skilled FM OB physicians who may practice in groups, and re-open closed rural hospitals to FM OB physicians to provide full-scope family practice services.","Resources to fund FM OB Fellowship programs do not exist in the traditional Graduate Medical Education funding formulas through CMS.  FM OB Fellowships are not ACGME accredited programs, nor does the American Board of Family Medicine even recognize any additional certification for FM OB Fellowship program graduates.  Most of these programs are self-funded through clinical revenue, hospitals, foundations or grants, and they are not profitable.  The American Board of Physician Specialties does offer a board-certification to family physicians who are surgically trained in FM OB fellowships, but this is a less recognized and prestigious certification than the ABFM provides.  The fact that the ACGME does not accredit these programs also hinders academic centers for providing sponsorship in the traditional manner.  When I graduated from my Family Medicine residency in 1981, approximately 30% of all family doctors nationwide provided maternity care.  Now, the number is just under 10%.  The extra cost and length of fellowship training, the mounting debt for medical school and residency training, the need to have enough numbers of FM OB providers to practice together and not get burned out, the extra cost of liability insurance for those who provide maternity care, the lack of rural hospitals that are open for maternity services, and even our own UAMS Department of OB/GYN's failure to provide adequate advanced surgical training to family medicine residents who wish to obtain it are all reasons why this problem exists.

Efforts to increase other workforces for maternity services by funding community health workers, doulas, certified nurse midwives, telehealth OB services are all good and support an interprofessional approach to providing care, but the FM OB physician has been left out of the equation.  Until this is recognized and addressed, I do not see how Arkansas will be able to solve our maternity care deserts crisis.","Family Medicine core requirements for all residents to graduate only include 2 months of OB and 20 deliveries.  For those who may wish to pursue an independent FM OB practice, our requirements must include a minimum of 4 months of OB training and 80 deliveries.  Even with the additional training in residency, it is doubtful that most FM residency graduates will be able to provide full-scope FM OB maternity services with surgical skills.  Training modules, sim labs and didactics are helpful, but hands-on clinical experience is often not provided by our practicing OB colleagues in FM residency programs in community hospitals, nor at the UAMS University hospital.  The small number of FM OB faculty in our residency programs does not allow for enough supervision and training for the FM residents to be surgically trained in 3 years.  In addition to producing practicing full-scope FM OB physicians who choose to practice in underserved areas, we need to also be populating our residency programs with fellowship trained FM OB faculty who can mentor, encourage and teach FM residents.  Without such, it is unlikely that the trend of only a small percentage of our graduates to provide full-scope FM OB care can be reversed.","For Family Medicine residency or FM OB Fellowship graduates, providing support for debt resolution as an incentive to practice in underserved areas would help.  Community and rural hospitals, civic organizations, city and rural municipalities, foundations and other benefactors as well as state legislative funding support could all be used to support the retention of FM and FM OB physicians to practice in our underserved areas.","Support Family Medicine resident programs in community hospitals, and encourage the hiring of FM OB faculty and OB/GYN faculty who are dedicated to the training of family medicine residents who seek the knowledge, skills and hands-on training required to choose an FM OB practice.  Too often, we find our OB/GYN colleague resentful or suspicious of family physicians who want to practice full-scope FM OB.  Family physicians are capable of providing these services if given the opportunity to learn.","Leadership all all levels in our academic institutions, our community and rural hospital training partners, our advisory board members, our civic leaders can all play a role in supporting the training of FM OB physicians.","Recognize that Family Medicine physicians need to play a role in the interprofessional team approach to providing full-scope FM OB maternity services.  Of all the efforts currently being generated in this area, it feels like the FM OB solution is not being recognized.","Those needed the most to meet the needs of supporting training in the FM residencies would include the addition of surgically trained FM OB faculty, supportive OB/GYN colleagues and hospital executives.  This same group would be needed to support the growth and development of FM OB Fellowship programs in our state.",,,,,,,"I am not sorry that I am so focused on this one area, but as a family physician who practiced low-risk nonsurgical OB for 25 years, and because I was never afforded the opportunity to get the advanced FM OB surgical training in our academic institution, I am passionate about the subject.  It grieves me that our state has such poor outcomes in infant and maternal morbidity and mortality.  We must reverse the trend of family physicians not being afforded the opportunity for training to practice full-scope FM OB practice in Arkansas, especially if we ever hope to increase the numbers of fully trained FM OB physicians.  We must encourage our medical students and FM residents to feel supported that this pathway can and should be a part of our interprofessional role in providing quality maternity care."

This includes investing in recruitment strategies that target underserved areas, offering career pathways such as apprenticeships or bridge programs, and removing barriers to entry for roles like medical assistants, community health workers, and behavioral health professionals.

Ultimately, a combination of pre-employment training, expanded recruitment pipelines, and targeted workforce development initiatives is necessary to ensure a high-quality, sustainable healthcare workforce.","Local colleges are not producing enough nurses or allied health professionals to meet current demand, which limits the available hiring pool. In addition, we face difficulty competing with the higher wages and incentives offered by travel nursing agencies and larger hospital systems. This makes both recruitment and retention challenging, particularly in rural or underserved areas. These factors create a cycle in which we are unable to expand or invest in internal training programs due to staffing shortages and limited budget flexibility.","We currently meet the training needs of individuals and teams primarily through onsite skills training and hands-on learning in the clinical setting. This allows new and existing staff to gain practical experience in real-time, supported by experienced team members. In addition, we are actively working with an apprenticeship program to develop a structured training pathway for medical assistants and other key roles. This initiative aims to strengthen our internal pipeline, provide career advancement opportunities, and ensure that staff are fully prepared to meet the demands of patient care from day one.",Depends on collaborative partnerships. ,"Expand Loan Repayment Incentives – Advocate for and promote state and federal loan repayment programs for a wider range of healthcare careers, including not only physicians and nurses but also behavioral health providers, medical assistants, and other high-demand roles. Increasing awareness and access to these programs can attract professionals who are burdened by student debt.

Reinvest in Rural Communities – Focus on revitalizing rural areas by improving housing, schools, broadband access, and recreational amenities. Healthcare professionals are more likely to stay long-term if they and their families feel a strong quality of life and sense of community.

Create Local Pipelines – Partner with schools, community colleges, and universities to introduce healthcare career pathways early, including dual-credit programs, internships, and job shadowing experiences that encourage students to train and remain in the region.","Currently, one of the most pressing training and development needs within our organization is management training, particularly for mid-level leaders and emerging supervisors. As frontline staff transition into leadership roles, there is a clear need for structured development in team management, communication, conflict resolution, performance coaching, and strategic thinking.","Expand Access to Local Training and Credentialing Programs
Partner with local colleges, universities, and apprenticeship programs to create more flexible, affordable, and accessible pathways for certification and degree advancement—especially for roles like nurses, medical assistants, behavioral health specialists, and community health workers.

Develop Career Ladders and Internal Advancement Opportunities
Create structured career pathways within healthcare organizations that clearly outline opportunities for advancement, skill development, and leadership roles. This helps retain talent and motivates professionals to grow within the region.

Support Continuing Education and Specialization
Offer tuition reimbursement, scholarships, or paid time for continuing education and specialty certifications (e.g., women’s health, geriatrics, behavioral health), allowing professionals to deepen expertise and expand their scope of care.","In our organization, the groups with the most significant training, development, and support needs include Medical Assistants, Dental Assistants, and billing department staff.

Medical Assistants and Dental Assistants often enter the workforce with varying levels of clinical training. They would benefit from more structured, hands-on training programs and career development opportunities, such as apprenticeship models or pathways to certification. Strengthening their foundational skills ensures high-quality patient care and improves staff retention.

Billing Department Staff are essential to the financial health of the organization. We are currently focused on developing these team members to become Certified Professional Coders (CPC). Formal certification will not only increase accuracy and efficiency in revenue cycle operations but also provide career growth and greater professional satisfaction.",,,,,,,
7/15/2025 11:18,7/15/2025 12:51,Heartland Forward,Benton,Benton,Benton,FALSE,Health & Wellness Director,4 years,Director,Director Level,Director,Administrative,4-5 years,malcala@heartlandforward.org,Yes,"We don't hire health care workforce per se, as we're an economic development think and do tank and one of our focus areas is health & wellness. However, we conduct applied economics research on this topic. For the NWA region, aside from specialists that we all know are needed, I think that it's becoming harder and harder to get lower skill workers, such as CNAs and other forms of care takers that go to the home because these positions pay so low and it's hard to retain them. Nurses are also a high need around here, primarily just general RNs because there seems to be a lack of motivation to stay in these positions. National studies tell us that about 35% of entry nurses leave their positions after the first year. The lack of proper mentoring may be an issue in that, as well as the lack of more on-the-job experiences (i.e. apprenticeships) aside from the traditional clinical trainings that are already required that don't seem to be enough for a 2yr RN program at a community college. In addition, nurses are constantly seeking to specialize and move out of basic care because many of those positions have become too monotonous and pay less. So we also need to enhance the compassionate care aspect in their training so that nurses can feel more motivated to do and stay in those jobs.  Health care workers also need to have their own peer-support groups.  Two other big issues when it comes to resources are housing and transportation in the area. Housing has become too expensive for the lower skill workers, which impacts CNAs, phlebotomists, nurses and so on. Moving around NWA requires significant gas expenses if you own a car and if you live in another town from where you work. Not everyone has a car for all adults in the household, not everyone has the money to pay for expensive repairs if the car breaks and so on. Because we don't have an effective public transportation system, it is hard to sustain the workforce that is needed most to get to and from their jobs daily. ","Again, this doesn't apply to us per se, but I can say that I see the following issues as bottlenecks. I apologize for focusing on nurses, but it's easier if I chose one field.  First, faculty pay is lower than clinical. So, say the pay for a nurse instructor is much lower than a nurse working at a hospital, so it's hard for people who want to be instructors to make that choice because they would be sacrificing too much income for their families. I know the state has made some improvements on this though working with community colleges. Second, licensing/certification barriers at the state level by the boards that control licensing and certification. Most of the requirements are still prioritizing classroom training and we're not counting/rewarding experience as much (i.e. competency-based skills). Example would be CNA working at a hospital, although the experience may be counted as a plus in a nursing program application, they are not necessarily getting credit hours for that, even though there is enough research out there showing that CNA experience is one of the most important experiences in retention of nurses down the road.",I would say that apprenticeships need to become a bigger component of all trainings. ,I've answered this as part of previous too.  I would also emphasize again here that we need to incorporate more apprenticeships or other forms of on-the-job training for all types of health care workforce.,"For doctors who are specialists: identify families that have members who are doctors working in other states. Those doctors, if they can be closer to their families with a good paying job in the area, are the ones that may be more likely to stay in the long-term after recruiting. To me the issue is more ""retaining"" than recruiting. Doctors may pass by here to get their experience and then move on to a better location if we don't have the right strategy to retain them. In addition, provide housing perks with conditions (i.e. they get a good chunk of money to buy a house, but they have to stay for at least a couple of years.). For lower-skills workers (i.e. CNAs, phlebotomists, LPNs, 2yr RN nurses and so on) focus on public transportation, providing career paths growth opportunities and peer-support groups.  In addition, we need to have some sort of ongoing program that focuses on awareness and training of compassionate care. Studies show (https://learn.hms.harvard.edu/insights/all-insights/measuring-benefits-compassion-healthcare) that compassionate care does not necessarily take more time, it simply requires more awareness and intention on the provider side and brings huge benefits: lower burnout among providers and better health outcomes among their patients. ",,"Compassionate care would be one I would make a priority. We focus a lot on the economics of this, but the underlying reason why people enter health care is because they want to care for others, have an impact on their lives. Here is an example of a story on that: marcusengel.com ",,,,,,,,Bottom line: bring back and raise the importance of compassionate care; recruit doctors who have family in the area; offer effective public transportation options for the lower-skills workforce; offer career pathways growth options; support with housing; enable peer-support groups for each type of workforce.

So more machines, more people trained to do and read the scans.   We need better access to high quality continuing education locally- not just online. ",The above is not really something that I feel that I have influence over as a clinician that's not in a management role. ,"Personally I am allotted some CME money annually, but it is not enough to cover the cost of a cme course and travel. As a PA, I take the same courses as MD's, but have 1/3 the annual budget at my institution. I will do online trainings and read journals. ","AS above- good grocery/childcare options. figure out a way to decrease flights out of XNA, providers don't want to live somewhere that its hard/expensive to travel from. Bentonville has grown and has a lot to offer, but the other surrounding communities have not seen that. We need access in all communities. Fayetteville and Springdale need those cultural/shopping/food options as well so that providers can live where they practice. We need better schools. We have some of the best schools in the state in our area- but they are not good compared to the rest of the nation. We need better support from the govt for good public schools. ","I think the area has improved dramatically on that front in the last 20yrs, however, it would be nice to have more food shopping options (Costco, sprouts, grocery stores other than Harps, Aldi and Walmart). More options for childcare- we work long hours and childcare options are limited. Cheaper flights- it is expensive to travel out of XNA.  ",I do not know,"Companies need to be willing to pay appropriately for rising costs and provide proper benefits. They should not be making providers sign non-competes so they can trap them in a position and treat them poorly. Providers need to have time off.

We need better pay for clinical staff- you can currently make more money at Chickfila than working as an MA or at the front desk of a clinic at most facilities.
